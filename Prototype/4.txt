Widow's Gift~Mark 12:41-44~Mark 12:43-44~Jesus said to his friends [disciples], “Learn now!  God has accepted that woman’s money [gift] with very much joy!  Some people gave much money, but they still had much money left. This woman is very poor. Yet, she has given all the money that she had [which she might have used for food today and tomorrow]!”
